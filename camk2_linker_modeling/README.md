# Data of the "linker in CaMKII-delta" project

1.camk2d nolinker models were based on the crystal structure from Can, just to add the missing loop.
2.camk2d exon14/18/r18 models were based on the camk2d nolinker model.

3.camk2a nolinker models were based on the crystal structure from PDB:3soa
4.camk2a exon18/r18 models were based on the camk2d nolinker model.

5.All linkers used are from sequence of variable linkers of camk2a.
